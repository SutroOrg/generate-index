# generate-index

Generate an index file that exports everything from all files in a directory.

**Currently TS only**

## Usage

Open a file in the folder you want the index.ts file to be generated. Then, activate the "Generate / update index file" command. The extension will create a file like so:

```tsx
export * from "./a"
export * from "./b"
export * from "./c"
```
